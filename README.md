# Overview

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
In this project, I have worked towards understanding Java. This included its syntax, functionality, and why it is such a strong and popular language in the software engineering field. While Java may be on the decline of popularity, it is still a vastly used language and I believe that it is vitally important to understand legacy code. As shown below, I have worked on a handful of smaller programs to utilize what I have been studying about the Java language:

* Binary Search: The first small program I wrote was a Java implementation of a Binary Search algorithm. This algorithm helped me become familiar with functions, arrays, and loops in the Java language.

* Bubble Sort: The second small program I wrote was a Java implementation of a Bubble Sort algorithm. Like the Binary Search algorithm before this, I was able to apply what I had learned about functions, arrays, and loops. However, this time I also become familiar with working with Boolean variable types.

* Reading Class: Finally, I wrote a small and simple program to learn about classes and data structures from the Java Collection Framework (ArrayList). This program utilized functions to tell you what book you were reading and how many pages you have read/have left to read. Additionally, in the Main function, you could add books to your reading list. This list would then be printed out to you.

In addition to these, I have also included all of the tutorial work/notes that I worked on while studying the Java language. The resources for my studies have been provided below.

# Development Environment

* VS Code - I utilized VS Code to develop the program.

* Java - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) says, "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible." This programming language is widely used in the Software industry (Google, Apple, etc.). While the language may be declining it popularity, there is still millions of lines of code written with Java. It is assumed that SWE will work with Java at some point.

# Future Work

* Now that I understand Java more, I would like to work on a more advanced project. This could be a recreation of a past project or a new one from scratch.
* I would like to research why Java is becoming less popular. Are there newer versions coming out?
